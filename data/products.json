[{"title":"Benelli TRK 502","price":"75000","imageUrl":"https://49f44b141764baa2639d-7ed4c224bc1671c64dae8740f0861232.ssl.cf6.rackcdn.com/motorcycles/trk502x_My2020/white/trk502x_My2020_white2.jpg","description":"Benelli’s TRK 502 X is always in the mood no matter what two-wheeled adventures you have in mind. Designed to conquer riding conditions known to man or motorcycle, the TRK 502 X charges into dirt, sand, and tarmac with equal abandon. Sporting higher ground clearance and more off-road-centric wheels and tires to go along with the same powerful liquid-cooled 500cc twin-cylinder engine featured on the base model TRK, the ‘X’ dares you to cross the line and fearlessly journey to parts unknown.\r\n"}]
